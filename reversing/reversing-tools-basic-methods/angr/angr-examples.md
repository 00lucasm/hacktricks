# Angr - Examples

### Find input to reach address

```python
import angr
import sys

def main(argv):
  path_to_binary = argv[1]  # :string
  project = angr.Project(path_to_binary)

  # Tell Angr where to start executing (should it start from the main()
  # function or somewhere else?) For now, use the entry_state function
  # to instruct Angr to start from the main() function.
  initial_state = project.factory.entry_state()

  # Create a simulation manager initialized with the starting state. It provides
  # a number of useful tools to search and execute the binary.
  simulation = project.factory.simgr(initial_state)

  # Explore the binary to attempt to find the address that prints "Good Job."
  # You will have to find the address you want to find and insert it here. 
  # This function will keep executing until it either finds a solution or it 
  # has explored every possible path through the executable.
  # (!)
  print_good_address = 0x804867d
  simulation.explore(find=print_good_address)

  # Check that we have found a solution. The simulation.explore() method will
  # set simulation.found to a list of the states that it could find that reach
  # the instruction we asked it to search for. Remember, in Python, if a list
  # is empty, it will be evaluated as false, otherwise true.
  if simulation.found:
    solution_state = simulation.found[0]

    # Print the string that Angr wrote to stdin to follow solution_state. This 
    # is our solution.
    print(solution_state.posix.dumps(sys.stdin.fileno()))
  else:
    raise Exception('Could not find the solution')

if __name__ == '__main__':
  main(sys.argv)
