## ASLR

**Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR)** is a security technique used in operating systems to **randomize the memory addresses** used by system and application processes. By doing so, it makes it significantly harder for an attacker to predict the location of specific processes and data, such as the stack, heap, and libraries, thereby mitigating certain types of exploits, particularly buffer overflows.

### **ASLR Not So Random**

PaX divides the process address space into **3 groups**:

* **Code and data** (initialized and uninitialized): `.text`, `.data`, and `.bss` ‚Äî> **16 bits** of entropy in the `delta_exec` variable. This variable is randomly initialized with each process and added to the initial addresses.
* **Memory** allocated by `mmap()` and **shared libraries** ‚Äî> **16 bits**, named `delta_mmap`.
* **The stack** ‚Äî> **24 bits**, referred to as `delta_stack`. However, it effectively uses **11 bits** (from the 10th to the 20th byte inclusive), aligned to **16 bytes** ‚Äî> This results in **524,288 possible real stack addresses**.

The previous data is for 32-bit systems and the reduced final entropy makes possible to bypass ASLR by retrying the execution once and again until the exploit completes successfully.

In 64bit systems the entropy is much higher and this isn't possible.

### **Checking ASLR Status**

To **check** the ASLR status on a Linux system, you can read the value from the `/proc/sys/kernel/randomize_va_space` file. The value stored in this file determines the type of ASLR being applied:

* **0**: No randomization. Everything is static.
* **1**: Conservative randomization. Shared libraries, stack, mmap(), VDSO page are randomized.
* **2**: Full randomization. In addition to elements randomized by conservative randomization, memory managed through `brk()` is randomized.

You can check the ASLR status with the following command:

```bash
bashCopy codecat /proc/sys/kernel/randomize_va_space
```

### **Disabling ASLR**

To **disable** ASLR, you set the value of `/proc/sys/kernel/randomize_va_space` to **0**. Disabling ASLR is generally not recommended outside of testing or debugging scenarios. Here's how you can disable it:

```bash
echo 0 | sudo tee /proc/sys/kernel/randomize_va_space
```

You can also disable ASLR for an execution with:

```bash
setarch `arch` -R ./bin args
setarch `uname -m` -R ./bin args
```

### **Enabling ASLR**

To **enable** ASLR, you can write a value of **2** to the `/proc/sys/kernel/randomize_va_space` file. This typically requires root privileges. Enabling full randomization can be done with the following command:

```bash
echo 2 | sudo tee /proc/sys/kernel/randomize_va_space
```

### **Persistence Across Reboots**

Changes made with the `echo` commands are temporary and will be reset upon reboot. To make the change persistent, you need to edit the `/etc/sysctl.conf` file and add or modify the following line:

```tsconfig
kernel.randomize_va_space=2 # Enable ASLR
# or
kernel.randomize_va_space=0 # Disable ASLR
```

After editing `/etc/sysctl.conf`, apply the changes with:

```bash
sudo sysctl -p
```

This will ensure that your ASLR settings remain across reboots.
