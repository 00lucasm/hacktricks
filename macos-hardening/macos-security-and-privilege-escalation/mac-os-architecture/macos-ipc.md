## IPC - Inter Process Communication

### Ports

Mach uses **tasks** as the **smallest unit** for sharing resources, and each task can contain **multiple threads**. These **tasks and threads are mapped 1:1 to POSIX processes and threads**.

Communication between tasks occurs via Mach Inter-Process Communication (IPC), utilizing one-way communication channels. **Messages are transferred between ports**, which act like **message queues** managed by the kernel.

Port rights, which define what operations a task can perform, are key to this communication. The possible **port rights** are:

* **Receive right**, which allows receiving messages sent to the port. Mach ports are MPSC (multiple-producer, single-consumer) queues, which means that there may only ever be **one receive right for each port** in the whole system (unlike with pipes, where multiple processes can all hold file descriptors to the read end of one pipe).
  * A **task with the Receive** right can receive messages and **create Send rights**, allowing it to send messages. Originally only the **own task has Receive right over its por**t.
* **Send right**, which allows sending messages to the port.
* **Send-once right**, which allows sending one message to the port and then disappears.
* **Port set right**, which denotes a _port set_ rather than a single port. Dequeuing a message from a port set dequeues a message from one of the ports it contains. Port sets can be used to listen on several ports simultaneously, a lot like `select`/`poll`/`epoll`/`kqueue` in Unix.
* **Dead name**, which is not an actual port right, but merely a placeholder. When a port is destroyed, all existing port rights to the port turn into dead names.

**Tasks can transfer SEND rights to others**, enabling them to send messages back. **SEND rights can also be cloned, so a task can duplicate and give the right to a third task**. This, combined with an intermediary process known as the **bootstrap server**, allows for effective communication between tasks.

#### Steps:

As it's mentioned, in order to establish the communication channel, the **bootstrap server** (**launchd** in mac) is involved.

1. Task **A** initiates a **new port**, obtaining a **RECEIVE right** in the process.
2. Task **A**, being the holder of the RECEIVE right, **generates a SEND right for the port**.
3. Task **A** establishes a **connection** with the **bootstrap server**, providing the **port's service name** and the **SEND right** through a procedure known as the bootstrap register.
4. Task **B** interacts with the **bootstrap server** to execute a bootstrap **lookup for the service** name. If successful, the **server duplicates the SEND right** received from Task A and **transmits it to Task B**.
5. Upon acquiring a SEND right, Task **B** is capable of **formulating** a **message** and dispatching it **to Task A**.

The bootstrap server **cannot authenticate** the service name claimed by a task. This means a **task** could potentially **impersonate any system task**, such as falsely **claiming an authorization service name** and then approving every request.

Then, Apple stores the **names of system-provided services** in secure configuration files, located in **SIP-protected** directories: `/System/Library/LaunchDaemons` and `/System/Library/LaunchAgents`. Alongside each service name, the **associated binary is also stored**. The bootstrap server, will create and hold a **RECEIVE right for each of these service names**.

For these predefined services, the **lookup process differs slightly**. When a service name is being looked up, launchd starts the service dynamically. The new workflow is as follows:

* Task **B** initiates a bootstrap **lookup** for a service name.
* **launchd** checks if the task is running and if it isn‚Äôt, **starts** it.
* Task **A** (the service) performs a **bootstrap check-in**. Here, the **bootstrap** server creates a SEND right, retains it, and **transfers the RECEIVE right to Task A**.
* launchd duplicates the **SEND right and sends it to Task B**.

However, this process only applies to predefined system tasks. Non-system tasks still operate as described originally, which could potentially allow for impersonation.

### Code example

Note how the **sender** **allocates** a port, create a **send right** for the name `org.darlinghq.example` and send it to the **bootstrap server** while the sender asked for the **send right** of that name and used it to **send a message**.

### Privileged Ports

* **Task port** (aka kernel port)**:** With Send permission over this port it's possible to control the task (read/write memory, create threads...).
  * Call `mach_task_self()` to **get the name** for this port for the caller task. This port is only **inherited** across **`exec()`**; a new task created with `fork()` gets a new task port (as a special case, a task also gets a new task port after `exec()`ing a suid binary). The only way to spawn a task and get its port is to perform the ["port swap dance"](https://robert.sesek.com/2014/1/changes\_to\_xnu\_mach\_ipc.html) while doing a `fork()`.
* **Host port**: If a process has **Send** privilege over this port he can get **information** about the **system** (e.g. `host_processor_info`).
* **Host priv port**: A process with **Send** right over this port can perform **privileged actions** like loading a kernel extension. The **process need to be root** to get tis permission.
  * Moreover, in order to call `kext_request` API it's needed to have the entitlement `com.apple.private.kext` which is only given to Apple binaries.
* **Task name port:** An unprivileged version of the _task port_. It references the task, but does not allow controlling it. The only thing that seems to be available through it is `task_info()`.
