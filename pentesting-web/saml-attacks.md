# SAML Attacks

## Basic Information

Security Assertion Markup Language \(SAML\) is an open standard that allows identity providers \(IdP\) to pass authorization credentials to service providers \(SP\). What that jargon means is that you can **use one set of credentials to log into many different websites**. It’s much simpler to manage one login per user than it is to manage separate logins to email, customer relationship management \(CRM\) software, Active Directory, etc.

SAML transactions use Extensible Markup Language \(XML\) for standardized communications between the identity provider and service providers. SAML is the link between the authentication of a user’s identity and the authorization to use a service. \(From [here](https://www.varonis.com/blog/what-is-saml/)\)

### SAML vs. OAuth

OAuth is a slightly newer standard that was co-developed by Google and Twitter to enable streamlined internet logins. OAuth uses a similar methodology as SAML to share login information. **SAML provides more control** to enterprises to keep their SSO logins more secure, whereas **OAuth is better on mobile and uses JSON**.

## Attacks

### Tampering with data

The request number 5 from the previous image sends back the information from the identity provider to the service provider. This information is **usually signed** at the end of the message so **no tampering with the information is possible**. It's recommended to check what happens in case the information is sent **stripping the signature** from the message.
