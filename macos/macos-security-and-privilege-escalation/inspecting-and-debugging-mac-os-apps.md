# Inspecting and debugging Mac OS Sotware

## Static Analysis

### otool

```bash
otool -L /bin/ls #List dynamically linked libraries
otool -tv /bin/ps #Decompile application
```

### SuspiciousPackage

\*\*\*\*[**SuspiciousPackage**](https://mothersruin.com/software/SuspiciousPackage/get.html) is a tool useful to inspect **.pkg** files \(installers\) and see what is inside before installing it.  
These installers have `preinstall` and `postinstall` bash scripts that malware authors usually abuse to **persist** **the** **malware**.

### hdiutil

This tool allows to **mount** Apple disk images \(**.dmg**\) files to inspect them before running anything:

```bash
hdiutil attach ~/Downloads/Firefox\ 58.0.2.dmg
```

It will be mounted in `/Volumes`

### Objective-C

When a function is called in a binary that uses objective-C, the compiled code instead of calling that function, it will call **`objc_msgSend`**. Which will be calling the final function:

![](../../.gitbook/assets/image%20%28559%29.png)

The params this function expects are:

* The first parameter \(**self**\) is "a pointer that points to the **instance of the class that is to receive the message**". Or more simply put, itâ€™s the object that the method is being invoked upon. If the method is a class method, this will be an instance of the class object \(as a whole\), whereas for an instance method, self  will point to an instantiated instance of the class as an object. 
* The second parameter, \(**op**\), is "the selector of the method that handles the message". Again, more simply put, this is just the **name of the method.** 
* The remaining parameters are any **values that are required by the method** \(op\).

| **Argument**   | **Register** | **\(for\) objc\_msgSend** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **1st argument**  | **rdi** | **self: object that the method is being invoked upon** |
| **2nd argument**  | **rsi** | **op: name of the method** |
| **3rd argument** | **rdx** | **1st argument to the method** |
| **4th argument** | **rcx** | **2nd argument to the method** |
| **5th argument** | **r8** | **3rd argument to the method** |
| **6th argument** | **r9** | **4th argument to the method** |
| **7th+ argument** | **rsp+ \(on the stack\)** | **5th+ argument to the method** |

These tools require **SIP to be disabled** or to copy the binaries to a temporary folder and **remove the signature** with `codesign --remove-signature <binary-path>`

### dtruss

```bash
dtruss -c ls #Get syscalls of ls
dtruss -c -p 1000 #get syscalls of PID 1000
```

### ktrace

You can use this one even with **SIP activated**

```bash
ktrace trace -s -S -t c -c ls | grep "ls("
```

### dtrace

It allows users access to applications at an extremely **low level** and provides a way for users to **trace** **programs** and even change their execution flow. Dtrace uses **probes** which are **placed throughout the kernel** and are at locations such as the beginning and end of system calls.

The available probes of dtrace can be obtained with:

```bash
dtrace -l | head
   ID   PROVIDER            MODULE                          FUNCTION NAME
    1     dtrace                                                     BEGIN
    2     dtrace                                                     END
    3     dtrace                                                     ERROR
   43    profile                                                     profile-97
   44    profile                                                     profile-199
```

The probe name consists of four parts: the provider, module, function, and name \(`fbt:mach_kernel:ptrace:entry`\). If you not specifies some part of the name, Dtrace will apply that part as a wildcard.

A more detailed explanation and more examples can be found in [https://illumos.org/books/dtrace/chp-intro.html](https://illumos.org/books/dtrace/chp-intro.html)

#### Examples

* In line

```bash
#Count the number of syscalls of each running process
sudo dtrace -n 'syscall:::entry {@[execname] = count()}'
```

* script

```bash
syscall:::entry
/pid == $1/
{
}

#Log every syscall of a PID
sudo dtrace -s script.d 1234 
```

```bash
syscall::open:entry
{
    printf("%s(%s)", probefunc, copyinstr(arg0));
}
syscall::close:entry
{
        printf("%s(%d)\n", probefunc, arg0);
}

#Log files opened and closed by a process
sudo dtrace -s b.d -c "cat /etc/hosts"
```

```bash
syscall:::entry
{
        ;
}
syscall:::return
{
        printf("=%d\n", arg1);
}

#Log sys calls with values
sudo dtrace -s syscalls_info.d -c "cat /etc/hosts"
```

### ProcessMonitor

\*\*\*\*[**ProcessMonitor**](https://objective-see.com/products/utilities.html#ProcessMonitor) is a very useful tool to check the process related actions a process is performing \(for example, monitor which new processes a process is creating\).

### fs\_usage

Allows to follow actions performed by processes:

```bash
fs_usage -w -f filesys ls #This tracks filesystem actions of proccess names containing ls
fs_usage -w -f network curl #This tracks network actions
```
