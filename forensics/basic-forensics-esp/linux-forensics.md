# Linux Forensics

## Search for known Malware

### Modified System Files

Some Linux systems have a feature to **verify the integrity of many installed components**, providing an effective way to identify unusual or out of place files. For instance, `rpm -Va` on Linux is designed to verify all packages that were installed using RedHat Package Manager.

```bash
#RedHat
rpm -Va
#Debian
dpkg --verify
debsums | grep -v "OK$" #apt-get install debsums
```

## Search installed programs

### Package Manager

On Debian-based systems, the _**/var/ lib/dpkg/status**_ file contains details about installed packages and the _**/var/log/dpkg.log**_ file records information when a package is installed.  
On RedHat and related Linux distributions the **`rpm -qa --root=/ mntpath/var/lib/rpm`** command will list the contents of an RPM database on a subject systems.

```bash
#Debian
cat /var/lib/dpkg/status | grep -E "Package:|Status:"
cat /var/log/dpkg.log | grep installed
#RedHat
rpm -qa --root=/ mntpath/var/lib/rpm
```

### Other

**Not all installed programs will be listed by the above commands** because some applications are not available as packages for certain systems and must be installed from source. Therefore, a review of locations such as _**/usr/local**_ and _**/opt**_ may reveal other applications that have been compiled and installed from source code. 

```bash
ls /opt /usr/local
```

Another good idea is to **check** the **common folders** inside **$PATH** for **binaries not related** to **installed packages:**

```bash
#Both lines are going to print the executables in /sbin non related to installed packages
#Debian
find /sbin/ -exec dpkg -S {} \; | grep "no path found"
#RedHat
find /sbin/ â€“exec rpm -qf {} \; | grep "is not"
```

## Inspect AutoStart locations

### Scheduled Tasks

```bash
cat /var/spool/cron/crontabs/*  \
/var/spool/cron/atjobs \
/var/spool/anacron \
/etc/cron* \
/etc/at* \
/etc/anacrontab \
/etc/incron.d/* \
/var/spool/incron/* \

#MacOS
ls -l /usr/lib/cron/tabs/ /Library/LaunchAgents/ /Library/LaunchDaemons/ ~/Library/LaunchAgents/
```

### Services

It is extremely common for malware to entrench itself as a new, unauthorized service. Linux has a number of scripts that are used to start services as the computer boots. The initialization startup script _**/etc/inittab**_ calls other scripts such as rc.sysinit and various startup scripts under the _**/etc/rc.d/**_ directory, or _**/etc/rc.boot/**_ in some older versions. On other versions of Linux, such as Debian, startup scripts are stored in the _**/etc/init.d/**_ directory. In addition, some common services are enabled in _**/etc/inetd.conf**_ or _**/etc/xinetd/**_ depending on the version of Linux. Digital investigators should inspect each of these startup scripts for anomalous entries.

* _**/etc/inittab**_
* _**/etc/rc.d/**_ 
* _**/etc/rc.boot/**_
* _**/etc/init.d/**_ 
* _**/etc/inetd.conf**_
* _**/etc/xinetd/**_
