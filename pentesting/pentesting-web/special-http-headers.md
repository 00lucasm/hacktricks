## Headers to Change Location

Rewrite **IP source**:

* `X-Originating-IP: 127.0.0.1` 
* `X-Forwarded-For: 127.0.0.1`
* `X-Forwarded:  127.0.0.1`
* `Forwarded-For: 127.0.0.1`
* `X-Remote-IP: 127.0.0.1` 
* `X-Remote-Addr: 127.0.0.1`
* `X-ProxyUser-Ip: 127.0.0.1`
* `X-Original-URL: 127.0.0.1`
* `Client-IP: 127.0.0.1`
* `True-Client-IP: 127.0.0.1`
* `Cluster-Client-IP: 127.0.0.1`
* `X-ProxyUser-Ip: 127.0.0.1`
* `Connection: close, X-Forwarded-For` \(Check hop-by-hop headers\)

Rewrite **location**:

* `X-Original-URL: /admin/console`
* `X-Rewrite-URL: /admin/console`

## Hop-by-Hop headers

A hop-by-hop header is a header which is designed to be processed and consumed by the proxy currently handling the request, as opposed to an end-to-end header.

* `Connection: close, X-Forwarded-For`

* `Content-Length: 30`
* `Transfer-Encoding: chunked`

## Cache Headers

* **`X-Cache`** in the response may have the value **`miss`** when the request wasn't cached and the value **`hit`** when it is cached
* **`Cache-Control`** indicates if a resource is being cached and when will be the next time the resource will be cached again: `Cache-Control: public, max-age=1800`
*  **`Vary`** is often used in the response to **indicate additional headers** that are treated as **part of the cache key** even if they are normally unkeyed.
* **`Age`** defines the times in seconds the object has been in the proxy cache.
