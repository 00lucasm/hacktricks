# UART

## Basic Information

It's important to note that in this protocol you need to connect the TX of one device to the RX of the other!

## Bus Pirate

In this scenario we are going to sniff the UART communication of the Arduino that is sending all the prints of the program to the Serial Monitor.

```bash
# Check the modes
UART>m
1. HiZ
2. 1-WIRE
3. UART
4. I2C
5. SPI
6. 2WIRE
7. 3WIRE
8. KEYB
9. LCD
10. PIC
11. DIO
x. exit(without change)

# Select UART
(1)>3
Set serial port speed: (bps)
 1. 300
 2. 1200
 3. 2400
 4. 4800
 5. 9600
 6. 19200
 7. 38400
 8. 57600
 9. 115200
10. BRG raw value

# Select the speed the communication is occurring on (you BF all this until you find readable things)
## Or you could later use the macro (4) to try to find the speed
(1)>5
Data bits and parity:
 1. 8, NONE *default
 2. 8, EVEN
 3. 8, ODD
 4. 9, NONE
 
 # From now on pulse enter for default
(1)>
Stop bits:
 1. 1 *default
 2. 2
(1)>
Receive polarity:
 1. Idle 1 *default
 2. Idle 0
(1)>
Select output type:
 1. Open drain (H=Hi-Z, L=GND)
 2. Normal (H=3.3V, L=GND)

Clutch disengaged!!!
To finish setup, start up the power supplies with command 'W'
Ready

# Start
UART>W
POWER SUPPLIES ON
Clutch engaged!!!

# Use macro (2) to read the data of the bus (live monitor)
