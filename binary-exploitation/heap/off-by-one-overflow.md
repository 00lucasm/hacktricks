## Basic Information

Having just access to a 1B overflow allows an attacker to modify the previous size metadata information, allowing to tamper which chunks are actually freed, finally generating a chunk that contains another legit chunk.

### Code Example:

* [https://github.com/DhavalKapil/heap-exploitation/blob/d778318b6a14edad18b20421f5a06fa1a6e6920e/assets/files/shrinking\_free\_chunks.c](https://github.com/DhavalKapil/heap-exploitation/blob/d778318b6a14edad18b20421f5a06fa1a6e6920e/assets/files/shrinking\_free\_chunks.c)
* This attack is no longer working due to the use of Tcaches.
  * Moreover, if you try to abuse it using larger chunks (so tcaches aren't involved), you will get the error: `malloc(): invalid next size (unsorted)`

### Goal

* Make a chunk be contained inside another chunk so writing access over that second chunk allows to overwrite the contained one

### Requirements

* Off by one overflow to modify the previous size metadata information

### Attack

* 3 chunks of memory (a, b, c) are reserved one after the other. Then the middle one is freed. The first one contains an off by one overflow vulnerability and the attacker abuses it with a 0x00 (if the previous byte was 0x10 it would make he middle chunk indicate that it‚Äôs 0x10 smaller than it really is).
* Then, 2 more smaller chunks are allocated in the middle freed chunk (b), however, as `b + b->size` never updates the c chunk because the pointed address is smaller than it should.&#x20;
* Then, b1 and c gets freed. As `c - c->prev_size` still points to b (b1 now), both are consolidated in one chunk. However, b2 is still inside in between b1 and c.
* Finally, a new malloc is performed reclaiming this memory area which is actually going to contain b2, allowing the owner of the new malloc to control the content of b2.
