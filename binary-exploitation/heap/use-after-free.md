## Basic Information

As the name implies, this vulnerability occurs when a program **stores some space** in the heap for an object, **writes** some info there, **frees** it apparently because it's not needed anymore and then **accesses it again**.

The problem here is that it's not ilegal (there **won't be errors**) when a **freed memory is accessed**. So, if the program (or the attacker) managed to **allocate the freed memory and store arbitrary data**, when the freed memory is accessed from the initial pointer that **data would be have been overwritten** causing a **vulnerability that will depends on the sensitivity of the data** that was stored original (if it was a pointer of a function that was going to be be called, an attacker could know control it).
