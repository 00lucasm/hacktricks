## Basic Information

### Code

* Check the example from [https://github.com/shellphish/how2heap/blob/master/glibc\_2.35/house\_of\_einherjar.c](https://github.com/shellphish/how2heap/blob/master/glibc\_2.35/house\_of\_einherjar.c)

### Goal

* The goal is to allocate memory in almost any specific address.

### Requirements

* Off by one over the header of the next chunk to modify the prev in use
* Be able to modify the `prev_size` data, which is part of the current chunk (at the end)
* Heap leak

### Attack

* `A` fake chunk is created inside a chunk controlled by the attacker pointing with `fd` and `bk` to the original chunk to bypass protections
* 2 other chunks (`B` and `C`) are created.
* Abusing the off by one in the `B` one the `prev in use` bit is cleaned and the `prev_size` data is overwritten with the difference between the place where the `C` chunk is allocated, to the fake `A` chunk generated before.
  * This `prev_size` and the size of the fake chunk `A` must be the same to bypass checks.
* Then, the Tcache is filled
* Then, `C` is freed so it consolidates with the fake chunk `A`
* Then, a new chunk `D` is created which will be starting in the fake `A` chunk and covering `B` chunk
* Then, `B` is freed and it's `fd` is overwritten to the target address making it point to the target address abusing the `D` chunk that contains it.
* Then, 2 mallocs are done because the second one if going to be containing the target address
