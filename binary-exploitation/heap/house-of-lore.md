## Basic Information

### Code

* Check the one from [https://ctf-wiki.mahaloz.re/pwn/linux/glibc-heap/house\_of\_lore/](https://ctf-wiki.mahaloz.re/pwn/linux/glibc-heap/house\_of\_lore/)
  * This isn't working
* Or: [https://github.com/shellphish/how2heap/blob/master/glibc\_2.39/house\_of\_lore.c](https://github.com/shellphish/how2heap/blob/master/glibc\_2.39/house\_of\_lore.c)
  * This isn't working even if tries to bypass the checks getting the error: `malloc(): unaligned tcache chunk detected` which might mean that the fake free list should be aligned
  * This could be bypassed aligning properly that list of fixing the second fake chunk to point to the arena (need a leak). However, it looks like this attack have too many requisites and few benefits.

### Goal

* Insert a fake small chunks in the small bin so then it's possible to allocate it.

### Requirements

* Create fake chunks
* Know the address of the victim chunk and the fake chunks
* Be able to modify the `bk` and `fd` pointers

### Attack

* A victim small chunk is allocated
* An attacker generates a couple of fake small chunks, and makes the first fake chunk `fd` point to a real chunk and the `bk` point to the second fake chunk. Also make the second fake chunk `bk` point the first one.
  * The `bk` of the second should also point to the fake freelist to prevent a crash when small bin chunks are tried to be allocated in the tcache.
* Then, a new large chunk is allocated to prevent the first one to being consolidate in the top chunk when freed
* Then, the initial pointer is freed and a second pointer of a bigger size is allocated so the freed initial small chunk is placed in the small bin.
* Vulnerability: The real small chunk freed is modified so it‚Äôs `bk` pointer points to the first fake chunk.
* Then, when 2 chunks of this size are allocated they get the valid chunk first and then the invalid chunk somehow controlled by the attacker.
  * In the how2heap example the fake chunks are inside the stack so we would be getting a chunk from the stack, where it might be possible to write a ROP or something.
