# Namespace Escalation

In Kubernetes it's pretty common that somehow **you manage to get inside a namespace** (by stealing some user credentials or by compromising a pod). However, usually you will be interested in **escalating to a different namespace as more interesting things can be found there**.

Here are some techniques you can try to escape to a different namespace:

### Abuse K8s privileges

Obviously if the account you have stolen have sensitive privileges over the namespace you can to escalate to, you can abuse actions like **creating pods** with service accounts in the NS, **executing** a shell in an already existent pod inside of the ns, or read the **secret** SA tokens.

For more info about which privileges you can abuse read:

{% endcontent-ref %}

### Escape to the node
